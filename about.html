<div class="about-content">
      <p>Welcome to the home of all things soft and fluffy.

        Here at Pet Marshmallow, we believe there is no such thing as a bad marshmallow, just bad owners. Every one of our adoptable marshmallows has the potential to be something great and they are just looking for the right home to do it in.

        We stated our plight to find homes for Marshmallows back at the start of the COVID pandemic. We noticed a lot of marshmallows were being left behind. The grocery stores and other markets did not have the foot traffic required to give each marshmallow a home. This is where we stepped up and started our program.

        We would like to thank everyone who has given a marshmallow a home, and if you are considering, don't procrastinate-ADOPT NOW!</p>
